Code and content (for now) for the upcoming version of https://romaricpascal.is.

The current version is utterly outdated (2+ years), both in its content and its code. A good occasion to tear everything to the ground and rebuild from scratch. Inspired by [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/redesign/), I'll publish in-progress version of the site as it evolves, and document my decisions & learnings through articles. Both a way to remember how I got there and to spread the best practices I know. The focus will be more on development than design, in a first part at least.

There will be mistakes, there will be wanderings, there will be backtracking, but it should be a fun journey of at least two main stages:

1. Build multilingual functionalities for a JavaScript static site generator.
2. Implement a new design and contents for the site

Already my brain calls for a third one, but lets see how things go with the first two:

3. Create an admin tool for the content.
