Moving files
===

New plugin: move suffix based files to the place they need to be:
`<language>/<key>`.

Keeping track of the extension opens up to using the same patter for assets.
A little tooling might be welcome for linking to those. Also noted that due to permalink,
there's a need of some '..' when setting images paths for ex. As well as warning of collisions.
