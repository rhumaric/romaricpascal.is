Minimal multilingual pages
---

First step towards multilingual site

Announcing the page language with the `lang` attribute
---

For that we'll need to know which language the page is in.
Before any automation, we'll handle that manually by adding a `language: ...` value in the front-matter and default it to `en` if none is specified.

Announcing the language of linked pages with `hreflang`
---

Same here, before any automation, we'll add things manually.
The first occurence of such link would be in the language switcher.
