About me
===

<div>

<img src="/media/me.png" alt="" class="avatar" role="presentation">

**Hello, I'm Romaric** and I've been building websites for more that 12 years now. Along the way, I've come to care about accessibility and performance to offer a good experience to the widest audience.

I focus on writing semantic templates and components, as well as maintainable CSS (from scratch or on top of libraries like Bootstrap),
to support various backends whether server-side like Rails or Django, or client-side like React or Vue.

</div>

While I'm also attached to privacy, I'm a big believer in sharing, whether it's [open-source code][github-profile] or [knowledge](#writings).

After a little more than 2 years in my previous position, I felt the need to go towards something different and take some time experimenting to figure out my next steps. This led to:

- [Rebuilding of this site with step by step documentation ](/posts/)
- [To/Fro][to-fro]: Volunteer work to collaborate on an app that coordinates volunteers supporting isolated people during the Covid19 crisis.<br> *Tech: Django, Bootstrap, SASS*
- [Various experimental projects](#other-projects)

In the past

### Nov. 2017 - Feb. 2020: Cookies HQ - Front-end developer

Conception and development of front-end components for various applications, coordinating with the backend developers and designers:

- Graph editor (JointJS) and its intergration with Rails templates and backend for [Stornaway][stornaway]
- Block editors (Vue admin + "public" rendering with Rails) for content creation:
  - page oriented, with focus on variying layouts, handling heading levels and responsive images (backgrounds and `<img>`) for [Patternbank content pages][patternbank]
  - form oriented, with focus on interaction between the different fields (show/hide, loading options) alongside the data collection for [Big Clean Switch][big-clean-switch] (as well as the embedding on their exist Wordpress site)
- Responsive e-commerce UIs (Rails rendering), especially the product listings with filtering, but also product pages, basket and/or checkout on sites like [Good Sixty], [Patternbank][patternbank-studio] or [Roughtrade]

*Tech: Rails, SASS, Bootstrap, Vanilla JS,Turbolinks, jQuery, VueJS*

I also tried to spread awareness for accessibility through:

- [an internal presentation][cookieshq-presentation]
- [articles on the company's blog][articles-at-cookies]
- [a public presentation at the Smart Cookies meetup][smart-cookies-accessibility]

<blockquote>

He was a key member of our team, leading the front-end development on many projects. He was our accessibility and ethics champion. He has challenged us more than anyone else, pushing us to constantly improve our processes and the way we approach projects.

We have learnt a lot from him. I think that, going forward, Nic and I will always have a little Romaric's voice in our heads but above all, we're very grateful for the 2 years that he has spent with us.

Other projects
---

Outside of client work, and [this website][romaricpascal.is], I also tinker with various little projects: small apps, tooling or just experiments with concepts or technology that feel interesting to me. Here are a selected few:

- [Taskfight]: A(n oldish) React app where tasks fight against one another to sort their priorities.
- [express-mount-files]: An ExpressJS middeleware to declare routes through folders and files, nostalgia of PHP's early days.
- [implicitjs]: Twisting JavaScript syntax with Babel to try and turn it into a templating language. Highly experimental.
- [An experiment with Bezier curves][bezier-experiment]: A Svelte app illustrating an idea for drawing a Bezier spline passing through a list of points.

Writings

I learnt a lot from what others shared, so it's only normal to try and reciprocate (with varying success at regularity):

- [On this site](/posts/): Currently sharing a step by step of the site's rebuild
- [On CookiesHQ blog][articles-at-cookies]: Accessibility and performance tips from when I was working there
- [On my previous site](https://old.romaricpascal.is/writing-about/): Mix of lettering and web development articles
